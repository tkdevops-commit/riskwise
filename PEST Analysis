PEST Analysis 

PEST Analysis is a strategic tool used to assess the macro-environmental factors
 
Political

Two predominant areas of focus:
1.	Political Stability
2.	Degree of Government Intervention

1. Political Stability

To evaluate political stability, consider:
•	Strength of institutions: Can they operate independently of political interference?
•	Frequency of power transitions: Are elections regular, peaceful, and respected?

2. Government Intervention

Assess both economic and regulatory intervention:
•	Economic intervention: Includes taxation policies, tariffs, subsidies, privatisation/nationalisation.
•	Regulatory intervention: Includes compliance obligations, anti-trust laws, labour/industrial relations legislation, and market entry controls.
 
Economic

Evaluate core indicators, for algorthmtic simplicity a focussed on current state of the economy:
• Unemployment rate - Partipation rates
• GDP - measure the economic activity
• Inflation rate - Stability of growth

Evaluate other indicators such as:
•	Domestic economic policy settings
•	Trade agreements and openness
•	Disposable income and cost of living
•	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
•	Consumer confidence
•	Interest rates and inflation trends
•	Market competition
• Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment

 
Social

Focus on workforce and societal trends:
•	Availability of a skilled labour force
•	Cultural attitudes and consumer behaviours
•	Digital literacy and education levels
•	Mobility and urbanisation
 
Technological

Assess how well innovation and infrastructure are supported:
•	Research and Development (R&D) output and funding
•	Supporting infrastructure (e.g. internet, logistics, energy)
•	Presence and maturity of local tech ecosystems
•	National investment in emerging technologies

Prediciting elemental change and potential causal change of events:

Example:
Tariffs -> change in cost -> output of production -> Employment and investment -> Consumer prices

 
Programmatic Assessment of Political Factors

To evaluate PEST programmatically, combine recognised global indicators, scoring systems, and real-time data sources.


- Political Factor:	How to Measure (Metric / Source)
- Political Stability:	World Bank Political Stability Index, Fragile States Index, Global Peace Index
- Corruption	Transparency: International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)
- Government Effectiveness:	World Bank Government Effectiveness Indicator (Worldwide Governance Indicators)
- Regulatory Quality:	World Bank Regulatory Quality Index
- Rule of Law:	World Justice Project Rule of Law Index
- Ease of Doing Business:	World Bank (historical) or Heritage Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index
- Freedom of the Press:	Reporters Without Borders – World Press Freedom Index
- Government Intervention:	Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom Index; policy analysis (e.g. subsidies, nationalisation flags)
- Bureaucracy: / Red Tape	World Bank reports, OECD, IMF business environment indicators
- Policy Change or Reform:	Scraped from official government websites, gazettes, or policy feeds via APIs and legal databases

Implementation Tips for App
1.	Use recognised global indices (scored 0–100 or 0–10) to build a composite political score.
→ Refer to a structured .json file for each country/region.
2.	Integrate real-time data feeds:
3.	Use governance indicators (e.g. World Bank APIs)
4.	Scrape press releases or policy bulletins from official government websites
5.	Monitor law or regulation databases using NLP where applicable

Logistic Regression will help quantify between analysis simplfying output to binary. 

1. Logistic Regression Model

We predict the probability p that an event occurs (e.g., success, “yes”, class 1):

p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}

Where:

z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
	•	p = predicted probability of the positive class
	•	e = Euler’s number (~2.71828)
	•	\beta_0 = intercept
	•	\beta_i = coefficient for predictor x_i

⸻

2. Odds and Log-Odds
	•	Odds:
\text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1 - p}
	•	Logit (log-odds):
\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n

⸻

3. Inverse Formula (to get p from log-odds)

p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n)}}
