PEST Analysis 

PEST Analysis is a strategic tool used to assess the macro-environmental factors
 
Political

Two predominant areas of focus:
1.	Political Stability
2.	Degree of Government Intervention

1. Political Stability

To evaluate political stability, consider
•	A functioning Government? Y/N
•	Strength of institutions: Can they operate independently of political interference? Y/N
•	Frequency of power transitions: Are elections regular, peaceful, and respected? Y/N
*Excluding executive agnecies


2. Government Intervention

Assess both economic and regulatory intervention:
•	Economic intervention: Includes taxation policies, tariffs, subsidies, privatisation/nationalisation.
•	Regulatory intervention: Includes compliance obligations, anti-trust laws, labour/industrial relations legislation, and market entry controls.

Economic

Evaluate core indicators, for algorthmtic simplicity a focussed on current state of the economy:
• Unemployment rate - Partipation rates - Natural rate to be used to calculate a stable range of unemployment. 
Typical stable range for developed economies 3-5% and 6-8% for developing countires. Y/N
• GDP - measure the economic activity
• Inflation rate - Stability of growth

Evaluate other indicators such as:
•	Domestic economic policy settings
•	Trade agreements and openness
•	Disposable income and cost of living
•	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
•	Consumer confidence
•	Interest rates and inflation trends
•	Market competition
• Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment

---

 
Social

Focus on workforce and societal trends:
•	Availability of a skilled labour force
•	Cultural attitudes and consumer behaviours
•	Digital literacy and education levels
•	Mobility and urbanisation

Corruption Perceptions Index - Ranks countries on scale of 0 - 100 based on business and expert assessments. 


---
 
Technological

Assess how well innovation and infrastructure are supported:
•	Research and Development (R&D) output and funding
•	Supporting infrastructure (e.g. internet, logistics, energy)
•	Presence and maturity of local tech ecosystems
•	National investment in emerging technologies

Prediciting elemental change and potential causal change of events:

Example:
Tariffs -> change in cost -> output of production -> Employment and investment -> Consumer prices

Programmatic Assessment of Political Factors

To evaluate PEST programmatically, combine recognised global indicators, scoring systems, and real-time data sources.


- Political Factor:	How to Measure (Metric / Source)
- Political Stability:	World Bank Political Stability Index, Fragile States Index, Global Peace Index
- Corruption	Transparency: International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)
- Government Effectiveness:	World Bank Government Effectiveness Indicator (Worldwide Governance Indicators)
- Regulatory Quality:	World Bank Regulatory Quality Index
- Rule of Law:	World Justice Project Rule of Law Index
- Ease of Doing Business:	World Bank (historical) or Heritage Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index
- Freedom of the Press:	Reporters Without Borders – World Press Freedom Index
- Government Intervention:	Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom Index; policy analysis (e.g. subsidies, nationalisation flags)
- Bureaucracy: / Red Tape	World Bank reports, OECD, IMF business environment indicators
- Policy Change or Reform:	Scraped from official government websites, gazettes, or policy feeds via APIs and legal databases

Implementation Tips for App
1.	Use recognised global indices (scored 0–100 or 0–10) to build a composite political score.
→ Refer to a structured .json file for each country/region.
2.	Integrate real-time data feeds:
3.	Use governance indicators (e.g. World Bank APIs)
4.	Scrape press releases or policy bulletins from official government websites
5.	Monitor law or regulation databases using NLP where applicable

Logistic Regression will help quantify between analysis simplfying output to binary.



Logistic Regression Analysis for Probability Estimation

Overview

This project uses logistic regression to estimate the probability of events occurring based on structured and unstructured data, such as information scraped from government and industry sources.

Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification — predicting whether something will happen (1) or not happen (0) — based on explanatory variables.
Instead of producing direct “yes/no” outcomes, logistic regression outputs probabilities (0 to 1), allowing for more nuanced decision-making.

⸻

Purpose

This analysis aims to:
	•	Transform raw data (e.g., from PEST analysis inputs) into usable features.
	•	Train a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an event occurring.
	•	Provide decision-makers with probabilistic insights rather than vague predictions.

Example:
	•	Using economic indicators from government reports to estimate the probability of a market downturn.
	•	Using policy announcements to predict the likelihood of a regulatory change within a year.

How It Works

1. Data Collection (What)
	•	Scrape relevant public data from government sites, reports, and APIs.
	•	Clean, normalize, and structure the data into a feature set (numeric or categorical).

2. Feature Engineering (Where)
	•	Extract meaningful variables from PEST analysis factors:
	•	Political: upcoming elections, policy changes.
	•	Economic: interest rates, inflation, GDP trends.
	•	Social: demographic shifts, consumer sentiment.
	•	Technological: patent filings, innovation indices.

3. Model Training (Why)
	•	Train a logistic regression model on historical labeled data (events that happened vs. didn’t happen).
	•	Learn the relationship between features and event likelihood.

4. Prediction & Interpretation (How)
	•	Input new or updated data into the model.
	•	Receive probability scores for the event in question.
	•	Use a probability threshold (e.g., >0.7) to classify as “likely.”

Example workflow

1. Data Input:

interest_rate, gdp_growth, unemployment_rate, election_year, event_occurred
3.0, 2.5, 4.1, 0, 1
4.5, 1.2, 6.0, 1, 0

2. Train Model:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3. Preddict:

probability = model.predict_proba(new_data)[:, 1]

4. Output:

Probability of Event: 0.82 (Likely)

Notes & Limitations
	•	Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the event.
	•	Requires clean and relevant data for reliable predictions.
	•	Not suitable for complex, highly non-linear problems (consider other models if performance is poor).
	•	Outputs are probabilities, not certainties — they should guide, not dictate, decisions.

Core forumula which predicts the probability within the function

P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots + b_nX_n)}}

Where:
	•	P(Y=1) = probability of “YES” (the outcome happening).
	•	b_0 = intercept (baseline).
	•	b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n = weights (decided during training).
	•	X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n = input variables (the factors we use to predict).
	•	e = Euler’s number (~2.718)

Logistic regression threshold

\text{If } P(Y=1) \geq 0.5 \text{ → Predict YES}
\text{If } P(Y=1) < 0.5 \text{ → Predict NO}

*Set benchmarks where there is limited historical data
