#RiskWise – Multi-Criteria Risk Assessment & Strategic Decision Tool

Overview
RiskWise is a strategic, lightweight, and structured decision-support tool designed to help individuals, teams, and organizations make clearer, more confident choices. Grounded in core economic principles, it enables users to identify and categorize risk, assess actual vs. perceived risk, evaluate opportunity costs, and apply game theory to analyze decisions in competitive environments.

Key Features

🧠 Risk Analysis
	•	Identify and classify different types of risk
	•	Compare actual vs. perceived risk to reveal decision bias
	•	Measure the gap between rational and intuitive risk responses
	•	Determine whether risk mitigation strategies may inadvertently increase exposure

💡 Opportunity Cost Evaluation
	•	Quantify trade-offs to support resource allocation decisions
	•	Integrate opportunity cost into risk and reward analysis
	•	Support strategic prioritization in line with organizational objectives

🎯 Strategic & Competitive Intelligence
	•	Use game theory to model and anticipate competitor or stakeholder decisions
	•	Evaluate finite games with fixed players and limited strategic choices
	•	Analyze Nash Equilibria to determine optimal responses
	•	Explore non-competitive and social-choice scenarios

📊 Quantitative Output
	•	Provide measurable outputs to support governance, compliance, and board-level reporting
	•	Enable scenario-based qualitative assessments

Formulas & Frameworks

1. Quantitative Risk Scores
	•	Actual Risk (AR):
AR = POE × IOE
(Probability of Event × Impact of Event)
	•	Perceived Risk (PR):
PR = PP × PI
(Perceived Probability × Perceived Impact)
	•	Gap Analysis:
Gap = AR – PR
(Difference between actual and perceived risk)

⸻

2. Qualitative Scenario Model

Perceived Risk Score
PRS = (P_s × I_s × F_h × F_c)
Where:
	•	P_s: Subjective Probability Score (1–5)
	•	I_s: Subjective Impact Score (1–5)
	•	F_h: Heuristic Factors (e.g., familiarity, media, trust, brand)
	•	F_c: Contextual Factors (e.g., power dynamics, culture, resources)

⸻

3. Game Theory Framework

Used when:
	•	Fixed number of players
	•	Limited strategy sets
	•	Finite outcomes
