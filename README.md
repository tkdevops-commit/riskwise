Risk assessment multi criteria tool

A management assessment tool used for making better decisions by assessing actual vs. perceived risk, evaluating the opportunity cost and ones own decisions against competitors. This project is design for individuals, business, management and teams that want lightweight structured way to assess and compare options based on risk dynamics, assisting with decision making leveraging digital tool in enhancing clearer decisions and comparing positions and competitve advatage based on game theory. This is a useful tool that is able to assist the user through a guided practical approach incorporating economic theories. 

Features:

- Evaluate actual vs. perceived risk
- Incorporate opportunity cost in decision making
- Quantitative output for risk assessment
- Optimising strategic decisions based on competitor choices 
- Simple and easy design

Forumulas 
Actual 
AR = POE * IOE

Perecieved
PR = PP * PI

Measure the gap difference
Gap = AR - PR

Quualitative scenarios
{Perceived Risk Score} = (P_s) \times (I_s) \times (F_h) \times (F_c)
Where:
	•	P_s: Subjective Probability Score (1–5)
	•	I_s: Subjective Impact Score (1–5)
	•	F_h: Heuristic Factors (familiarity, media coverage, trust, brand etc.)
	•	F_c: Contextual Factors (power dynamics, org culture, org objectivs, resource allocation.)

Opportunity cost = What is given up over what is gained
