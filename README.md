Interactive Risk Assessment Tool

This project is an interactive front end web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users assess and prioritise risks using a risk matrix. A risk matrix is a visual tool used during risk assessment to categorise risks based on the likelihood that they will occur and the impact they would have if they did. This structured approach helps teams and individuals focus on the most important risks and make informed decisions quickly and clearly.  

Key Features
•	Risk Matrix Visualisation that places risks on a grid of likelihood versus impact.  
•	Interactive scoring to explore and compare risk levels based on user input.  
•	Decision support to help identify where mitigation efforts should be prioritised.  
•	Fully front end implementation that runs entirely in the browser with no backend dependencies.

What It Solves

A risk matrix provides a simple, structured way to evaluate potential threats by considering both how likely they are and how severe their consequences could be. By mapping these two dimensions visually, users can quickly see which risks require immediate attention and which can be monitored or accepted.
