Forumulas 
Actual 
AR = POE * IOE

Perecieved
PR = PP * PI

Measure the gap difference
Gap = AR - PR

Quualitative scenarios
{Perceived Risk Score} = (P_s) \times (I_s) \times (F_h) \times (F_c)
Where:
	•	P_s: Subjective Probability Score (1–5)
	•	I_s: Subjective Impact Score (1–5)
	•	F_h: Heuristic Factors (familiarity, media coverage, trust, brand etc.)
	•	F_c: Contextual Factors (power dynamics, org culture, org objectivs, resource allocation.)
