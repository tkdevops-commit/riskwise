Logistic Regression Analysis for Probability Estimation

📌 Overview

This project uses logistic regression to estimate the probability of events occurring based on structured and unstructured data, such as information scraped from government and industry sources.

Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification — predicting whether something will happen (1) or not happen (0) — based on explanatory variables.
Instead of producing direct “yes/no” outcomes, logistic regression outputs probabilities (0 to 1), allowing for more nuanced decision-making.

🎯 Purpose

This analysis aims to:
	•	Transform raw data (e.g., from PEST analysis inputs) into usable features.
	•	Train a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an event occurring.
	•	Provide decision-makers with probabilistic insights rather than vague predictions.

Example:
	•	Using economic indicators from government reports to estimate the probability of a market downturn.
	•	Using policy announcements to predict the likelihood of a regulatory change within a year.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Data Collection (What)
	•	Scrape relevant public data from government sites, reports, and APIs.
	•	Clean, normalize, and structure the data into a feature set (numeric or categorical).

2. Feature Engineering (Where)
	•	Extract meaningful variables from PEST analysis factors:
	•	Political: upcoming elections, policy changes.
	•	Economic: interest rates, inflation, GDP trends.
	•	Social: demographic shifts, consumer sentiment.
	•	Technological: patent filings, innovation indices.

3. Model Training (Why)
	•	Train a logistic regression model on historical labeled data (events that happened vs. didn’t happen).
	•	Learn the relationship between features and event likelihood.

4. Prediction & Interpretation (How)
	•	Input new or updated data into the model.
	•	Receive probability scores for the event in question.
	•	Use a probability threshold (e.g., >0.7) to classify as “likely.”

Example workflow

1. Data Input:

interest_rate, gdp_growth, unemployment_rate, election_year, event_occurred
3.0, 2.5, 4.1, 0, 1
4.5, 1.2, 6.0, 1, 0

2. Train Model:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3. Preddict:

probability = model.predict_proba(new_data)[:, 1]

4. Output:

Probability of Event: 0.82 (Likely)

📌 Notes & Limitations
	•	Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the event.
	•	Requires clean and relevant data for reliable predictions.
	•	Not suitable for complex, highly non-linear problems (consider other models if performance is poor).
	•	Outputs are probabilities, not certainties — they should guide, not dictate, decisions.
