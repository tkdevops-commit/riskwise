1. Logistic Regression Model

Wht is it? A statistical method used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.




We predict the probability p that an event occurs (e.g., success, “yes”, class 1):

p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}

Where:

z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
	•	p = predicted probability of the positive class
	•	e = Euler’s number (~2.71828)
	•	\beta_0 = intercept
	•	\beta_i = coefficient for predictor x_i

⸻

2. Odds and Log-Odds
	•	Odds:
\text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1 - p}
	•	Logit (log-odds):
\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n

⸻

3. Inverse Formula (to get p from log-odds)

p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n)}}
